This is a repository to show some of the various Data Science related projects I have completed.

Classification with Multiple Classes and Natural Language Processing: In this project I practiced using NLP Classification models to predict labels with high accuracy. I pre-processed the data and ran various models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine to determine which model had the highest accuracy.
