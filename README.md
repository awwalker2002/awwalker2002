This is a repository to show some of the various Data Science related projects I have completed.

[Classification with Multiple Classes and Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/awwalker2002/awwalker2002/blob/b4a86f64bfba6a393683276e65fefa0764f69d78/Classification%20with%20Multiple%20Classes%20and%20Natural%20Language%20Processing.ipynb): In this project I practiced using NLP Classification models to predict labels with high accuracy. I pre-processed the data and ran various models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine to determine which model had the highest accuracy.
